'''A path of dependent dynamical systems.

This is a first step towards more general networks of interdependent
dynamical systems.  The approach is inspired by Mason (1953, Â§II).

In graph theory (Gondran & Minoux 1984, p. 13), 'a path is a chain all
of whose arcs are directed in the same way'.  Further, 'an elementary
path is a path that does not meet the same vertex twice', which is
really what's addressed here.

Really it's a list of systems, with the output of each becoming the
input of the next; the list is the basic Pythonic data structure that
most of the methods of this class work with.
